#Free Rice Bot

[Freerice.com](http://freerice.com) is an online SAT study game that donates 10
grains of rice to the hungry for each correct answer. This is a Processing/Java
bot that constantly plays the game and donates rice. It also logs the approximate
accumulated amount of rice that has been donated using the bot.

##Using the Bot
This program is optimized for a 15in macbook but could easily be adapted to work
with any computer. After downloading the repo contents follow these steps to constantly
donate rice when you're not using your computer.

    1. Make sure that Safari is completely closed and there are no important unsaved documents
    open on your machine (just to be safe). Only use freeRice when you are not going to be using your
    computer for something else.
    2. Plug your computer into a power source so that your battery doesn't die while your're donating rice. 
    3. Open processing and run the freeRice.pde sketch.
    4. Once finished donating rice, press COMMAND+ALT+ESC to bring up the force quit menu and force quit
    (or regular quit) the sketch. Your mouse will still be controlled by the bot but it is pretty easy
    to close the program with a little effort. 
    5. Open the total.txt file in the data folder to see how much rice you donated.
    6. Keep donating rice!
    

WARNING: This sketch takes control of your mouse and keys. If you dont feel comfortable
with that do not use it. Also, I threw this together in a few hours and I don't really know
how well it works with other peoples comps/setups. That said there isn't really anything to be
worried about.
